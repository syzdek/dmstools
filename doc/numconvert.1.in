.SH NAME
numconvert \- displays values using multiple numeral systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnumconvert\fR [\fB-BbDdlOoRrsXx\fR] [\fInumber1 number2 ... numberN\fR] 
.sp
\fBnumconvert\fR [\fB--help\fR | \fB-h\fR] [\fB--version\fR | \fB-V\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBnumconvert\fR utility is a filter which displays numbers using different
numeral systems.  Input strings which are prefixed with \fI0x\fR are assumed to be
 hexidecimal numerals.  Input strings which are prefixed with a single `\fI0\fR'
character are assumed to be octal numerals.  Input strings which are prefixed with
`\fI00\fR' are assumed to be binary numerals.  All other strings are assumed
to be in decimal numerals.
